Summary
=======

The |plugin| provides versioning of geographical features stored in PostGIS databases.  A typical use case met by the plugin involves one or more users checking out a local working copy to edit features in (potentially) offline mode using SpatiaLite and committing changes back to the PostGIS server.

More information can be found in the plugin's `original page`_ page.
